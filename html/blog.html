                My note is to all 2rd year guys 2024 batch. Placements season has been reopen. So get ready to face
                different kind of challenges. This is the time when you will get ups and downs in your life. But it is not necessary all will get selected/hired
                some will get hired some will get another chance in their life. Those who have achieved success at their
                first try congratulations to them, but those who haven't achieved success, you will get many
                opportunities in your life. You need to wait for the right time, don't let negative things to come in
                your mind. After all it's your mind or it's you only who is responsible for all the things, for your
                success, for your failure. Rather you should not use the word "Failure" just interpret it as " this
                didn't worked, I need to find a different way". Yes It's possible your previous way is also correct but
                sometimes life ask for perfect things too.
                It give us chance to become perfect.<br><br>

                A common situation comes in engineering student's lives , student A has started preparing for the exam
                or interview more earlier than his classmate. Now, Student A and his classmate gave the same exam or
                have appeared for same company, as according to previous records yes Student A have more marks than his
                classmate, he have done more things compared to his classmates. But ultimately, his classmate get
                the job first.<br><br>
                Here's the situation where student A feels frustrated, irritated and . But is this correct? No.
                But that's how life is - The more you want something, the more you chase for something God will keep
                taking it away and that's because he has planned something more good for you.
                Student A kept preparing more and more he never gave up . Tough time made him stronger.
                Once again he tried for some company X but again the same thing happened his roommates were placed but
                he wasn't.<br><br>

                He was happy for them, it wasn't jealousy, we think we are jealous but that feeling was
                different that's sadness when you try really hard and you don't get things.
                It hurts when you work so hard but God keeps giving to someone who already have something, it's normal
                to feel upset and sad but don't let yourself struck in it.<br><br>

                Because God makes difficult situation more difficult just to see your patience and how much you are
                determined towards working hard.<br><br>

                So just remember the more the rejections more will be the chances of your success . Don't let your
                failure define you. Do not pay attention to the people who criticize you and makes you feel demotivated.<br><br>

                <b>One lesson : "sometimes late success is a blessing in disguise".</b><br><br>

                Yes finally Student A get job after all his struggle and belive me it will always something more than
                the companies you got rejected.<br><br>

                All the failure and struggles are basically a blessing it does not only gives you success it makes you
                strongest.<br><br>

                That's all Guys,<br><br>
                Don't stop when you are tired.. stop when you are done.<br><br>

                <b>All the best for your career!</b>
